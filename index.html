I am a former political scientist using computational social science methods to study democracy. I have since left academia for industry. I'm leaving this website up so that scholars who wish to access my replication materials may continue to do so. If you have any questions or issues with the data/code then please feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:zachwarner11@gmail.com">via email</a>.
