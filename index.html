I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science (Data Science) at <a href="https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/polsci/">Purdue University</a>. I am core faculty in the <a href="https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/cornerstone/index.html">Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts</a> program and affiliated faculty in the <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/amap/">Advanced Methods at Purdue (AMAP)</a> cluster. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/law-politics">School of Law and Politics</a> at <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a>. I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://polisci.wisc.edu/">Department of Political Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in 2018. <br> <br>

My research is organized around two themes: institutional design and representation. My book project examines why so many countries around the world have created new districts, states, and other subnational units since 1960, with a focus on Nigeria. My other work examines why the poor are underrepresented relative to the rich among the world's democracies. Both themes use, improve, and develop new quantitative and computational methods. <br> <br>
