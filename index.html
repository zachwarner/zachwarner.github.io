I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Centre for Political and Legal Analytics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/the-centre-for-political-and-legal-analytics) at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk)'s [School of Law and Politics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/law-politics). From August 2021 I will be an Assistant Professor of Political Science & Data Science at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/)'s [Department of Political Science](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/polsci/).

My research is organized around two themes: institutional design and representation. My book project examines why so many countries around the world have created new districts, states, and other subnational units since 1960, with a focus on Nigeria. My other work examines why the poor are underrepresented relative to the rich among the world's democracies. Both themes use, improve, and develop new quantitative and computational methods.

Previously, I have been a consulting researcher for the [Latin American Public Opinion Project](http://vanderbilt.edu/lapop/) at [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu), [HM Prison and Probation Service Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/her-majestys-prison-and-probation-service), and [HM Department for International Development](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development). I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu) in 2018.
